## Price Recommendation System for Online Sellers


### Project Overview

Online sellers operating on e-commerce platforms often struggle to determine the most effective pricing strategy due to multiple influencing factors such as market competition, customer demand, product attributes, and seasonal trends. Incorrect pricing decisions can lead to reduced profitability or loss of competitive positioning.

This project focuses on developing an intelligent, data-driven pricing recommendation system that assists sellers in setting optimal product prices. By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, the system analyzes historical data, competitor pricing, and product characteristics to recommend competitive yet profitable price points in a dynamic e-commerce environment.

### Problem Statement

The primary objective is to design a scalable and user-friendly pricing recommendation system capable of answering the following:

**How can online sellers determine competitive and profitable product prices using data-driven insights in a rapidly changing e-commerce marketplace?**

Key challenges addressed include:

* Managing large and complex datasets generated by e-commerce platforms
* Adapting pricing recommendations to changing market conditions
* Incorporating competitor price analysis alongside cost and margin considerations
* Ensuring scalability across diverse product categories and seller sizes
* Providing simple, interpretable recommendations for non-technical users

### Key Features and Methodology

* **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Integrated datasets including product information, historical prices, seller ratings, and reviews.
* **Feature Engineering:** Developed meaningful variables such as category, brand influence, customer feedback, and seller performance metrics.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest for price prediction.
* **Recommendation Engine:** Designed a system to suggest competitive price ranges for new product listings.
* **Data Visualization:** Presented insights using graphical dashboards for easier interpretation of pricing trends.
* **Scalability:** Structured the system to support large datasets and potential real-time applications.

### Results and Insights

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Majority of products were priced within the $10–$20 range, indicating a dominant pricing segment.
* Leading brands included Nike, PINK, Victoria’s Secret, and LuLaRoe.
* Women’s category contributed the highest product volume across datasets.

**Model Performance:**

* Linear Regression: RMSLE – 0.4748
* Random Forest: RMSLE – 0.7192
* Ridge Regression: RMSLE – 0.4745 (Best performance)

The Ridge Regression model demonstrated superior predictive capability and was selected as the final model for price recommendations.
